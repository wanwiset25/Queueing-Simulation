# Queueing-Simulation
This is a mini project for the class EE555: Broadband Network Architectures. It is a Queueing Simulation app with a friendly UI. There are 5 scenarios in total and this project is implemented in Python.

Scenario 1 simulates M/M/c/c queue. It takes in the arrival rate (lambda), the service rate (mu), the desired probability of blocking (P_b). It outputs the minimum number of servers 'c' required. 

Scenario 2 simulates an M/M/c queue. It takes in the arrival rate (lambda), the service rate (mu), the probability that a server is busy (epsilon), and the average waiting time (alpha).  It outputs the number of servers required to satisfy the conditions, the average number of busy servers, and the average number of packets in the system.

The notation of queueing models are represented by Kendall's notation, more information can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall%27s_notation
